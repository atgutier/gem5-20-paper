\titlenote{
    gem5 is the result of the merger of the GEMS project started in 1999, and the m5 project started in 2003.
    Development of gem5 has been active for about 20 years, and this version is being published in 2020. Thus, ``gem5-20''.
}

\begin{abstract}
    The open-source and community-supported gem5 simulator is one of the most popular tools for computer architecture research.
    This simulation infrastructure allows researchers to model modern computer hardware at the cycle level, and it has enough fidelity to boot unmodified Linux-based operating systems and run full applications for multiple architectures including x86, Arm\textregistered, and RISC-V.
    The gem5 simulator has been under active development over the last nine years since the original gem5 release.
    In this time, there have been over 7000 commits to the codebase from over 250 unique contributors which have improved the simulator by adding new features, fixing bugs, and increasing the code quality.
    In this paper, we give an overview of gem5's usage and features, describe the current state of the gem5 simulator, and enumerate the major changes since the initial release of gem5.
    We also discuss how the gem5 simulator has transitioned to a formal governance model to enable continued improvement and community support for the next 20 years of computer architecture research.

\section{Conclusion}

Over the past nine years, the gem5 simulator has become an increasingly important tool in the computer architecture research community.
This paper describes the significant strides taken to improve this community-developed infrastructure.
Looking forward, with the continued support of the broader computer architecture research community, the gem5 simulator will continue to mature and its use will continue to grow.
The community will continue to add new features, add new models, and increase the stability of the simulator.

The overarching goal of the future development of the gem5 simulator is to increase its user base by expanding its use both within the computer architecture community and in other computer systems research fields.
To accomplish this goal, we will be providing ``known-good'' configurations and other tools to enable reproducible computer system simulation.
We will also provide more user support to broaden the gem5 community through improved documentation and learning materials.
Through these efforts, we look forward to continue to grow and improve the gem5 simulation infrastructure through the next 20 years of computer system development.

\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:acks}

The development of gem5 is community-driven and distributed.
The contributions to the gem5 community go beyond just the source code, and many people who have contributed to the broader gem5 community are not acknowledged here.

We would like to specially acknowledge the late Nathan Binkert.
Nate was a driving force behind the creation of gem5 and without his vision and his dedication to code quality this open-source community infrastructure would not be the success that it is today.

The gem5 project management committee consists of Bradford Beckmann, Gabriel Black, Anthony Gutierrez, Jason Lowe-Power (chair), Steven Reinhardt, Ali Saidi, Andreas Sandberg, Matthew Sinclair, Giacomo Travaglini, and David Wood.
Previous members include Nathan Binkert, and Andreas Hansson.
The project management committee manages the administration of the project and ensures that the gem5 community runs smoothly.

This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation (CNS-1925724, CNS-1925485, CNS-1850566, and many others) and Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Google has donated resources to host gem5's codes, code review, continuous integration, and other web-based resources.

This work was partially completed with funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under project Mont-Blanc 2020, grant agreement 779877.
